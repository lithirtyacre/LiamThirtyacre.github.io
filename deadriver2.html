    <h1>You swim across the river...</h1>
    <p>
   You strip to your johnnies, take a deep breath and cannon ball into the river. After getting used to the freezing water you start to swim across only to run into a school of piranhas. The piranhas tear you to shreads as you think "What the heck are piranhas doing in a fresh water river???
      YOU'RE DEAD
