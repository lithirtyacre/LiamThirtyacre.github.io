    <h1>You offer the river monsters chapstick...</h1>
    <p>
  A feeling of dred and impending doom washes over you as you offer your cherry vinilla chapstick to the alpha river monster Zenu. Zenu inspects the chap stick and eats it with a mighty bite. A smile grew over the alpha Zenu, he liked it! You are revered as an ally and friend to the river monsters. After a feast of fish and hikers the river monsters offer you safe passage across the river.
